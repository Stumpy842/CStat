This project contains a WinForms application built with Visual Studio 2022. It is call CStat Calculator and is intended to be used by users of Mapper32 and EDuke32.

Its purpose is to calculate and display the cstats/flags which are used in Mapster32 for setting properties of sprites, walls and ceilings/floors.

The user may enter a number in decimal, hexadecimal or binary, then see the resulting flags which are set. Alternatively you may select any items from the listview and calculate the resulting cstat flags number corresponding to the selection.

The operation is simple and straightforward. A Help menu item is now available.
